For this challenge, we had to connect INT1 low. To use paulmon as an on-chip debugger. We have to change a line in extra.asm file. Which makes it to run in single step mode such that we can use paulmon as on chip debugger. In this folder the modifed extra.asm file has been attachted. In this folder, I have submitted my asm and hex file used for single stepping and also the extra.asm edited file.
